This report presents a context-aware system that enables users to control a smart home using gestures. Bluetooth Low Energy beacons are used to position a user wearing a smartwatch indoor. Gesture recognition is performed on the smartwatch. When a gesture is recognized, the system attempts to recognize the context the user is situated in and based on the context, the smart devices in the smart home change to an appropriate state. We use the gesture performed by the user and the position of the user as \emph{contextual information}.

The design and implementation of the prototype is presented and the results of a user test focusing on the prototype is discussed.
