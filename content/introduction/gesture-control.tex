\subsection{Gesture Control}
\label{sec:introduction:gesture-control}

It is intuitive that the amount of gestures a person is able to recall is limited and that the smaller a set of gestures is, the easier it is for a person to remember. This is supported by \cite{Kela2006} wherein a user study reported that users would like to be able to use the same gesture for multiple devices, as well as keep the set of gestures available should be kept relatively small.
Reuse of gestures across multiple devices results in fewer gestures overall that a person has to remember, but imposes the challenge of making sure that only the user's intended target device reacts to a gesture.
