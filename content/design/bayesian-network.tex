\section{Bayesian Network}
\label{sec:design:bayesian-network}

Determining the correct action to trigger based on the contextual information is done using a Bayesian network. The network is illustrated in \cref{fig:design:bayesian-network:overview}. We consider there to be the following three levels in the network.

\begin{itemize}
\item The uppermost level containing the ``Gesture'', ``Room'', ``TV\_IsOn'' and ``MusicCentre\_IsPlaying'' nodes provides contextual information.
\item The middle level observes, \ie~is children of, the uppermost level to provide probabilities for each action in the system based on a subset of the information observed in the uppermost level.
\item The bottom level observes all nodes in the middle level to provide probabilities for the actions in the system. Based on these probabilities the correct action to perform is determined.
\end{itemize}

The benefit of this structure is, that contextual information such as the performed gesture and the users position is always translated to probabilities for actions and these probabilities are independent of other contextual information that we may observe. When the contextual information is modelled as probabilities for actions, it becomes trivial to combine all the contextual information to choose the right action to perform.

The probability tables and conditional probability tables shown in \cref{tbl:design:bayesian-network:pt-gesture-room,tbl:design:bayesian-network:pt-tv-ison-musiccentre-isplaying,tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-gesture-action,tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-room-action,tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-system-state-action,tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-action} only show selected states. In reality, the tables include states for all gestures, rooms and actions in the system but some have been left out for readability purposes.

\end{figure}

\Cref{tbl:design:bayesian-network:pt-gesture-room} shows an excerpt of the probability table for the gesture node. The node contains probabilities for all gestures in the system. The probability is the same for all gestures in the system. This is because the user is equally likely to have performed the gestures when we have not observed anything else. Based on the likelihoods of each gesture supplied by the gesture recognizer, we can add soft evidence to the Gesture node. The evidence is assigned as described in \cref{sec:design:bayesian-network:gesture-node-evidence}.

When using a Bayesian network, we assign evidence to the states of a node. If a node, $X$, in a bayesian network has states $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ then an evidence function $\epsilon_X = (1, 0, 0)$ indicates that $X = x_1$, \ie~node $X$ is in state $x_1$ with certainty. If $\epsilon_X = (1, 2, 0)$ then we are sure that $X$ is not in state $x_3$ and $X = x_2$ is twice as likely as $X = x_1$ \cite[pp. 23-24]{kjaerulff2008bayesian}. The probabilities for a column in a conditional probability table should have a sum of 1. That is for a node $X$, $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + ... + P(X_n) = 1$ where $n$ is the number of states in $X$.

As per Kj√¶rulff \etal\cite[pp. 23-24]{kjaerulff2008bayesian} we distinquish between \emph{hard evidence} and \emph{soft evidence}. If an evidence function assigns a probability of zero to all but one state in a node, then there is \emph{hard evidence} on that one state. If an evidence function assigns evidence to multiple states, there is said to be \emph{soft evidence} on the states.

The Gesture, Room, TV\_IsOn and MusicCentre\_IsPlaying nodes constitute the uppermost level in the network. The middle level is constituted by the Gesture\_Action, Room\_Action and System\_State\_Action nodes.

The nodes on the middle level observes nodes in the uppermost level and based on the observed information, compute probabilities for the all actions in the system. Without any evidence on a state, the probabilities of the states in nodes in the middle level is determined by gesture configurations.

Consider the probabilities of the Gesture\_Action node as shown in \cref{tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-gesture-action}. In the scenario presented in \cref{sec:analysis:scenarios} we presented a configuration of the system. \Cref{tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-gesture-action} shows an excerpt of the configuration in which the user has configured the Z gesture to turn Lamp 3 and Lamp 8 on and off. The Half Circle gesture skips to the next track on the music centre and changes to the next channel on the television. The Horizontal Line gesture skips to the previous track on the music centre and changes to the previous channel on the television. The valid actions for each gesture have the same probability.

As the Gesture\_Action node observes the Gesture node, the probabilities of each action are changed when evidence is added to the states of the Gesture node.

The principle oof the Room\_Action and System\_State\_Action nodes are the same as the Gesture\_Action node. Each state of the nodes correspond to an action in the system. The probabilities of the nodes change when evidence is added to the Room, MusicCentre\_IsPlaying and TV\_IsOn nodes.

The evidence added to the states of the Room node, is likely to be soft evidence as we adjust the probability of the user being in a room over time as he walks around as described in \cref{sec:design:bayesian-network:room-node-evidence}. The evidence of the MusicCentre\_IsPlaying and TV\_IsOn nodes are hard evidence as we can observe this with certainity from the state of items in openHAB.

Based on the information observed from the Gesture\_Action, Room\_Action and System\_State\_Action nodes, the Action node calculates probabilities of each action in the system. The probabilities of the node are used to determine which action to trigger.

\Cref{tbl:design:bayesian-network:cpt-action} shows a very small excerpt of the conditional probability table of the Action node. For readability purposes the table only contains two states, A and B. We assume A and B are actions in the system. For example, $\text{A} = \text{``Lamp 3: on/off''}$ and $\text{B} = \text{``Music centre: next track''}$.

When System\_State\_Action = $A_1$, Room\_Action = $A_1$ and Gesture\_Action = $A_1$ there is hard evidence that action A should be triggered. The same applies for action $A_2$ when all three nodes are in state $A_2$. If only two two nodes are in state $A_1$, then the probability of $P(Action=A_1) = \frac{2}{3}$ and as a result $P(Action=A_2) = \frac{1}{3}$ and vice versa.
