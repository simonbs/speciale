\section{Status}
\label{sec:implementation:status}

As part of the project we have designed and implemented a context-aware home automation solution on an Android Wear and a Raspberry Pi with Philips Hue light bulbs and a MacBook running a Spotify client acting as the controllable devices.

\subsection{Implemented Features}

Below we present the features implemented as part of the project. Features are grouped by the hardware the software is running on.

\subsubsection{Android Wear}

The user utilizes the Android Wear smart watch to perform gestures which starts the context recognition process. The following features were implemented on the watch.

\begin{itemize}
\item Training of gestures using the 1\textcent~gesture recognizer as described in \cref{sec:design:gesture-recognition}.
\item Recognition of gestures using the 1\textcent~gesture recognizer.
\item Positioning of the user using Estimotes BLE beacons as described in \cref{sec:design:ble-positioning}.
\item Setup of gesture configurations, i.e. a combination of a gesture, a room and an action.
\item Recognition of the context using a Bayesian network as described in \cref{sec:design:bayesian-network}.
\end{itemize}
