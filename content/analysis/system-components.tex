\section{System Components}
\label{sec:analysis:system-components}

The following section summarize the hardware components needed in order to design and implement the scenarios presented in \Cref{sec:analysis:scenarios}.

We envision two different configurations of the system. Both confgiurations assume that bluetooth technology is utilized to determine the position of the user. \todo[author=Simon]{Reference to where we determine that bluetooth is used for positioning.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item One configuration in which the wearable continously scan for bluetooth beacons. The wearable determines the position of the user based on data advertised by the bacons.
\item Another configuration in which bluetooth enabled microcontrollers scan for wearables and uploads the RSSI to a central location in which the position of the user is determined based on the set of available RSSIs.
\end{enumerate}

The idea of the second configuration is to design the system in such a way that it works on wearables that do not provide access to the bluetooth APIs. A microcontroller should do one of the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item It should either continously scan for wearables and read their RSSI.
\item Given the MAC address of the wearable, it should obtain the RSSI.
\end{itemize}

The second configuration was abandoned due to restrictions posed by the Bluetooth LE specification. The specification poses the following limitations that prevent such a system from working properly.

\begin{itemize}
\item A Bluetooth LE peripheral (e.g. a wearable) can only be the slave of one master, that is, it can only be paired with one central.
\item A peripheral must advertise in order to be discovered by a central. Advertising requires a piece of software to be running on the peripheral and thus access to the bluetooth API.
\item A central can obtain an RSSI based on the MAC address of a peripheral. However, the bluetooth specification allows a peripheral to change its MAC address in order to prevent tracking of the user.
\end{itemize}

\todo[author=Simon]{Add references on above claims.}

The rest of the report will focus on the first configuration of the system.
