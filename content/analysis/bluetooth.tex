\subsection{Bluetooth}
\label{sec:analysis:bluetooth}

We use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in order to position the user wearing the smartwatch. Bluetooth is a standard for short-range and low-power wireless communication between devices and is commonly found in a broad range of devices including desktop computers, phones and speakers~\cite{gupta2013inside}.

Bluetooth has a maximum range of 100 meters but is typically used for much shorter distances~\cite[p. 20]{gupta2013inside}. Accomplishing the maximum range is difficult as walls, furniture and people can dampen the strength of the signals~\cite{faragher2014analysis}.

\Cref{fig:analysis:bluetooth:highlevel-architecture} shows the high-level layered architecture of Bluetooth. The layers are described below.

\begin{description}
\item[Lower layers] Perform low level operations, including discovering devices, establishing connections and exchanging data packets. The functionality is implemented on the Bluetooth chip~\cite[pp. 21-22]{gupta2013inside}. We will not go into details about this layer.
\item[Upper layers] Use functionality of the lower layers to perform complex functionality, including transferring large amounts of data by splitting it into multiple packets and streaming of data~\cite[p. 22]{gupta2013inside}.
\item[Profiles] The profiles define how the protocol layers within the upper and lower layers implement specific use cases, \eg~proximity detection~\cite[p. 22]{gupta2013inside}.
\item[Applications] These are applications utilizing the Bluetooth stack, \eg~mechanisms for discovering and connecting to Bluetooth devices, choosing music to stream and selecting files to transfer~\cite[p. 22]{gupta2013inside}.
\end{description}

As part of the upper layers, is the Logical Link Control and Adaption Protocol, abbreviated L2CAP. The protocol builds on top of protocols in the lower levels, to exchange data with a remote Bluetooth device. L2CAP provides functionality that includes segmentation and reassembly of packets, quality of service, streaming data and retransmission of packets. Devices communicating using L2CAP exchange Packet Data Unit (PDU) packets, containing information about the L2CAP protocol, \eg~the type of the PDU and a payload~\cite[pp. 80-83]{gupta2013inside}. For example, the PDU type of a beacon can be \texttt{ADV\_NONCONN\_IND}, indicating a non-connectable undirected advertising packet. The payload of a PDU is referred to as the Service Data Unit (SDU) which originates from a level above the L2CAP, \eg~the Attribute Protocol~\cite[p. 201]{gupta2013inside}.

Attribute Protocol, abbreviated ATT, uses L2CAP to transfer data. Mechanisms provided by ATT include discovering the attributes provided by a remote device and reading and writing the attributes. An attribute represents data, for example the temperature from a thermostat, the unit in which the temperature is provided or the name of a device. Attributes can be pushed or pulled to and from a remote device. Attributes have a handle that identifies an attribute, a value and access permissions. The protocol works in a client-server manner in which a server exposes a set of attributes and a client can read and write the attributes~\cite{gupta2013inside}.

The Bluetooth Core 4.0 Specification~\cite{bluetooth2010bluetooth_7_vol}, \ie~the specification including BLE, introduces the General Attribute Profile (GATT) architecture illustrated in \Cref{fig:analysis:bluetooth:gatt-architecture}. The GATT framework specifies how a device can discover, read, write and indicate its characteristics. Profiles consist of one or more services that are needed in order to provide a specific functionality, \eg~proximity monitoring~\cite[p. 259-261]{gupta2013inside}. Services provide one or more characteristics that describe a feature, \eg~the temperature of a thermostat. Services may be shared by multiple profiles.

The Bluetooth Special Interest Group, the group that maintains the Bluetooth standards, provide a range of profiles, \eg~a proximity profile for monitoring the distance to devices and a profile for heart rate sensors.
Apple and Google have developed the iBeacon and Eddystone profiles, respectively, for region monitoring.
Eddystone GATT profile defines the Eddystone Service that advertises \emph{frames} of information. These are described in detail in \Cref{sec:design:ble-positioning} as well as the Eddystone Configuration Services in which a device is connectable and the advertised values can be configured by a client BLE-enabled device.
