\label{chap:implementation}

The following chapter describes the implementation of the system. Jayes, the third party implementation used for the Bayesian network is briefly presented. We give a detailed description of the \emph{context engine}, which provides developers with a flexible way of supporting new context in the system. The implementation used for communicating with OpenHAB is briefly described and lastly the prototype is presented.
